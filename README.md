# Keylogger - Capture Every Keystroke
Project Overview - This project is a simple keylogger program designed to capture and store keystrokes in a text file. The keylogger works by initializing and monitoring keystrokes, capturing each key pressed, and storing the data for later review.

Features - Keystroke Capture: Monitors and records all keystrokes.
Data Storage: Stores captured keystrokes in a text file for later review.
Easy to Use: Simple execution and output retrieval process.

Requirements - Python 3.x
Required Libraries: pynput

How It Works - Initialization: The keylogger initializes and starts monitoring keystrokes.
Keystroke Capture: Each key pressed is captured and stored in a list.
Data Storage: The captured keystrokes are written to a text file for later review.

Security and Ethical Considerations - Please note that keyloggers can be used maliciously. This project is intended for educational purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before using keyloggers and respect privacy and legal boundaries.

Conclusion - The Keylogger project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to capture and store keystrokes using Python. It provides a foundation for understanding keystroke logging and can be extended for more advanced functionalities.
